# George Hotz tinygrad Optimization Livestream Summary

This transcript captures George Hotz (geohot) working on optimizing the "openpilot" neural network model to run efficiently in tinygrad, his neural network framework.

## Technical Achievements

George implemented several optimizations to reduce both memory usage and execution time:

1. **Graph Optimization Techniques**:
   - Merged movement operations (reduced ~400 nodes)
   - Combined element-wise operations
   - Shuffled movement operations to better positions in the graph
   - Removed unnecessary movement operations
   - Merged element-wise operations into convolution outputs

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Fixed a significant bottleneck in OpenCL kernel argument passing
   - Implemented extensive caching for operations
   - Reduced Python overhead
   - Optimized shape tracking for tensor operations

3. **Results**:
   - Reduced runtime from ~800ms to ~20ms on an NVIDIA 3090
   - Achieved ~40-50ms on Mac M1
   - ~1.5 seconds on a comma three device (target hardware)
   - Reduced kernel dispatches from 450+ to 216

4. **Visualization**:
   - Used a graph visualization showing operations as colored nodes:
     - Red nodes: Processing ops (convolutions)
     - Green nodes: Movement ops (reshape, permute)
     - Gray nodes: Element-wise ops (add, multiply)

## Future Goals

- Fix shape tracker to enable remaining optimizations
- Use specialized convolution kernels with images instead of buffers
- Beat the current SNPE implementation (20ms) on the comma three device
- Eventually incorporate tinygrad into openpilot

The latter portion of the stream shifted to non-technical topics including politics, economics, and various countries.
