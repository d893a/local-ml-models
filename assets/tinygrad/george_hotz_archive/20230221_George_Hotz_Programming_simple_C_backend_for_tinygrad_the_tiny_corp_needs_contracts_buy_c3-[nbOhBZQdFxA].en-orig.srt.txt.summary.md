# George Hotz's tinygrad Stream Summary

George Hotz livestreamed the development of a C backend for tinygrad (a deep learning framework), showcasing the transformation from concept to working web application in a single session.

## Key Achievements:

1. **C Backend Implementation**:
   - Created "Ops clang" for tinygrad
   - Made it similar to existing OpenCL backend
   - Demonstrated compilation and execution flow

2. **Portable EfficientNet Classifier**:
   - Compiled the EfficientNet model to pure, portable C code
   - Created a standalone executable that only needs standard libraries
   - Demonstrated image classification working with minimal dependencies

3. **WebAssembly Version**:
   - Converted the C implementation to WebAssembly
   - Built a browser interface with JavaScript
   - Added webcam support for real-time classification
   - Made it work across desktop and mobile browsers

## Business Context:
Throughout the stream, George discussed "tiny Corp" needing contracts and mentioned how this demonstration showcases their capabilities. He repeatedly joked about needing to make money from tinygrad and hoping the demo would get attention on Hacker News to attract business.

## Technical Details:
- The C version runs very efficiently (around 300ms per image)
- The web version allows users to input image URLs or use their webcam
- The code handles all the tensor operations needed for neural network inference
- He highlighted how portable and dependency-free the solution is

The stream demonstrated impressive technical skills, transitioning from backend implementation to web development in a single session while maintaining a focus on performance and portability.
