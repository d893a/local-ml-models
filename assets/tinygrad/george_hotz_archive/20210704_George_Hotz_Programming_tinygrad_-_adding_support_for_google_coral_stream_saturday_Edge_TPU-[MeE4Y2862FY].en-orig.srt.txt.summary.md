# George Hotz Programming Stream: Adding Google Coral Edge TPU Support

## Stream Overview
This transcript captures George Hotz (geohot) working on adding support for Google's Coral Edge TPU hardware, a machine learning accelerator. The stream combines technical programming with philosophical tangents and social commentary.

## Technical Journey
- George attempts to build and link various libraries required to work with the Edge TPU (tensorflow lite, lib_edge_tpu)
- Encounters numerous dependency issues and compilation problems on his M1 Mac
- Eventually creates a simplified Python wrapper to interface with the Edge TPU without all the complex dependencies
- Successfully tests the device with various images (banana, cat, hotdog), demonstrating correct image classification
- Begins reverse engineering the Edge TPU firmware to understand its operation

## Key Accomplishments
- Created a minimal Python implementation (185 lines) that replaces Google's complex library dependencies
- Implemented firmware download functionality to initialize the device
- Demonstrated image classification using the Edge TPU
- Started analyzing the firmware using reverse engineering tools

## Other Stream Content
- Musical interludes with piano playing
- Social commentary on various topics including capitalism, society's problems, and freedom
- Takes online quizzes including an IQ test
- Discusses potential countries to live in based on their economic freedom
- Reflections on corporate culture and tech industry trends

The stream concludes with George encouraging viewers to reflect on whether they're "part of the problem" in society and to make better personal choices.
