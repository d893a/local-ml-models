# George Hotz Matrix Multiplication Optimization Stream Summary

In this livestream, George Hotz ("geohot") demonstrates how to optimize matrix multiplication from scratch, progressing from a basic implementation to a highly optimized version that exceeds NumPy's performance.

## Key Progression:

1. **Starting Point**: Simple nested loop matrix multiplication in Python using NumPy, establishing a baseline performance (~1 TFLOP)

2. **Basic C Implementation**: Converting to C code, initially getting poor performance (~0.7 GFLOPS)

3. **Cache Awareness**: Restructuring the code to be cache-friendly by blocking the matrices into chunks that fit in L1 cache

4. **SIMD Optimization**: Using AVX/FMA intrinsics to perform multiple floating-point operations simultaneously
   - Discovered that AVX-2 is for integers, needed FMA3 for floating-point operations
   - Used `mm256` intrinsics for vector operations

5. **Memory Access Patterns**: Swizzling/reordering the matrices to achieve coalesced memory access

6. **Multi-threading**: Adding pthread implementation to utilize multiple CPU cores

## Results:

- **Single-threaded**: Achieved performance within 5% of theoretical maximum
- **Multi-threaded**: Reached 1.3-1.4 TFLOPS consistently (with 8 threads)
- **Compared to NumPy**: Outperformed NumPy in both single and multi-threaded scenarios

## Challenges:

- CPU throttling when using all cores, limiting maximum performance
- Cache misses causing performance bottlenecks
- Complex memory access patterns requiring careful optimization
- Compiler behavior affecting optimization choices

The stream demonstrates the importance of understanding hardware architecture (CPU caches, SIMD instructions) and memory access patterns when optimizing numerical code. George plans to continue the optimization journey by implementing matrix multiplication on GPUs in a future stream.
