# George Hotz tinygrad Stream Summary

In this programming stream, George Hotz (geohot) works on developing a custom RISC-V processor design specialized for AI acceleration, intended to work with tinygrad (a lightweight neural network framework).

## Main Technical Focus

- Designing a custom processor with efficient matrix multiplication capabilities for AI workloads
- Creating a Python-based simulator for the custom RISC architecture
- Implementing matrix multiplication operations that can handle both even and uneven matrix sizes
- Comparing his approach to existing AI accelerators from NVIDIA and Tesla

## Key Implementation Details

- Focused on optimizing a 32x32 matrix multiplication unit
- Created load/store instructions with stride parameters to efficiently handle memory access patterns
- Implemented working matrix multiplication for varying sizes using masking instead of padding
- Discussed the importance of training vs inference optimization, noting many companies focus only on inference chips

## Side Topics

- Shared his music (released under the name "Tom Cruise") and discussed upgrading his recording equipment
- Brief discussions about education, skills, and various tangential topics

The stream demonstrates his iterative development approach of "guessing and testing" while implementing the core matrix operations needed for neural network acceleration on custom hardware.
