# George Hotz Rectified Flow Diffusion Stream Summary

In this programming stream, George Hotz implements rectified flow for diffusion models using TinyGrad. The goal was to create a model that could generate MNIST digits from noise.

## Key points:

- **Rectified Flow**: A technique where diffusion trajectories become straight paths instead of curved ones, potentially making the process more efficient
- **Implementation**: George built a model combining:
  - Transformer blocks or convolutional layers
  - Time step embeddings
  - Class label conditioning

## Challenges faced:

- Initial implementation produced noise instead of recognizable digits
- The transformer architecture was complex to debug
- Time step embedding was causing unexpected problems

## Debugging process:
1. Created an ASCII art visualizer to see outputs directly in terminal
2. Tried replacing transformer with simpler convolutional layers
3. Tested model on single sample overfit to verify basic functionality
4. Discovered the time step embedding was breaking the model

## Solution:
- Replaced complex sinusoidal time embedding with a simple embedding matrix
- Added proper class conditioning
- Successfully generated "504" digits that looked progressively better as training continued

The stream demonstrates the iterative debugging process common in ML development, with George eventually getting a working rectified flow implementation that could generate and condition MNIST digits.
