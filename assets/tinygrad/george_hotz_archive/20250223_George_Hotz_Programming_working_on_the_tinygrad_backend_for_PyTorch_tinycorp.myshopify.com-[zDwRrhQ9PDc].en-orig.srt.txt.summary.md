# George Hotz Programming Stream: Building a PyTorch Backend for tinygrad

In this programming stream, George Hotz works on implementing a PyTorch backend for tinygrad, allowing PyTorch code to run on tinygrad's tensor implementation. Here's what happened:

## Key Developments

- **Backend Approach**: Rather than making tinygrad fully compatible with PyTorch (which is impossible due to subtle differences), George is creating a PyTorch backend that uses tinygrad's implementation.

- **Implementation Progress**:
  - Created a wrapper that translates PyTorch tensor operations to tinygrad operations
  - Implemented several PyTorch A10 functions (the internal dispatching system) including random, uniform, add_mm, log_softmax, and more
  - Got a ResNet18 image classification example working with the chicken image correctly classified

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Dealing with PyTorch's as_strided operations (related to tensor reshaping)
  - Implementing various math operations with correct signatures
  - Attempted to use PyTorch decompositions but had difficulty getting them to work consistently

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Ecosystem Integration**: Makes tinygrad available to the entire PyTorch ecosystem without requiring code changes
- **Testing Opportunity**: Provides a way to verify tinygrad's tensor operations match PyTorch's behavior
- **Performance**: Could potentially offer better performance on certain hardware through tinygrad's optimizations

## Next Steps

- Implement more PyTorch operations (~250 methods needed)
- Fix the as_strided implementation (currently using workarounds)
- Run PyTorch's test suite against the tinygrad backend

George was enthusiastic about this approach as it lets tinygrad complement rather than compete with PyTorch while bringing tinygrad's optimizations to PyTorch users.
