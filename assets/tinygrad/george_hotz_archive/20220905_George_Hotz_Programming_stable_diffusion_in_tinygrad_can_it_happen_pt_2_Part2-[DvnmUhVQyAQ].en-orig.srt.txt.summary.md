# George Hotz Stable Diffusion in Tinygrad Programming Stream Summary

In this programming stream, George Hotz works on implementing stable diffusion in tinygrad, a minimalist machine learning framework. The stream continues his previous work, where he had implemented the autoencoder component.

## Main Progress

- **Focus of stream**: Implementing the UNet model, a critical component of stable diffusion
- **Implementation approach**: Converting PyTorch code to tinygrad while understanding the underlying architecture
- **Components implemented**:
  - Time embeddings
  - Diffusion model structure (input blocks, middle blocks, output blocks)
  - Spatial transformers and attention mechanisms
  - Various ResNet blocks and normalization layers

## Technical Challenges

- **Memory issues**: Had to use `tensor.nograd = True` to prevent out-of-memory errors
- **Attention mechanisms**: Implemented multiple slightly different transformer architectures
- **Shape mismatches**: Spent significant time debugging tensor dimension problems
- **Weight initialization**: Created optimization for faster model loading

## Results

- Got the UNet model to run, producing a barely recognizable output image
- The image quality is poor because:
  - The CLIP model for text conditioning isn't implemented yet
  - Random context is being used instead of proper conditioning
  - Likely has numerous bugs in the implementation

## Next Steps

1. Implement the CLIP text encoder model
2. Add token embeddings for text processing
3. Write the sampler for the diffusion process
4. Compare outputs with PyTorch implementation to find bugs
5. Fix "17 million bugs" to make it work properly

The stream ended with George mentioning he might continue implementation later the same day or in a future stream.
