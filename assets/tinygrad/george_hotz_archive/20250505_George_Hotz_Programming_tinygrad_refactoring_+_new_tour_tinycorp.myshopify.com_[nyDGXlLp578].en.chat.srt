After all that, you can buy some chips but we're going to need to sell you support at 15% of your hardware purchase price

03:32:12,150 --> 03:32:14,150
Temppus: we take that :D

620
03:32:13,758 --> 03:32:15,758
snorlaxcantfly: :(

621
03:32:22,473 --> 03:32:24,473
nuttyodin1: distracted with tariff talk

622
03:32:27,126 --> 03:32:29,126
m4l4r100: can you give us kisses?

623
03:32:28,430 --> 03:32:30,430
pronto_letterbox: deepsek help

624
03:32:57,009 --> 03:32:59,009
nwerd_gamer: gave my cousin :p gave my cousin :p

625
03:33:36,999 --> 03:33:38,999
Gameplayer0618: @imkuee yeah, some Europe countries are super strict on this

626
03:35:43,231 --> 03:35:45,231
m4l4r100: when is tinysearch coming?

627
03:36:21,937 --> 03:36:23,937
leikowo: test_tensor still passes when replacing rewrite_shapetracker_with_index with the new stuff directly

628
03:36:47,296 --> 03:36:49,296
0xmalvee_: is this 10k monitor

629
03:39:09,097 --> 03:39:11,097
reathal: !tinygrad

630
03:39:09,977 --> 03:39:11,977
UltraScientism: Do you ever think "It would have been nice if I decided to write tinygrad in something statically typed like Ocaml" ?

631
03:39:39,246 --> 03:39:41,246
dramatemple: Ocami?

632
03:40:15,680 --> 03:40:17,680
m4l4r100: grow it, light it, blaze it

633
03:40:34,473 --> 03:40:36,473
inceptiondev: @UltraScientism 🚀🚀 yo bro did you ever think of rewriting it in rust 🚀🚀🚀🌙

634
03:41:02,385 --> 03:41:04,385
leikowo: @inceptiondev the rust stream was kinda nice

635
03:41:17,084 --> 03:41:19,084
nwerd_gamer: rewrite in holy c

636
03:41:19,338 --> 03:41:21,338
urnebeani: Is he back in the usa ?

637
03:41:20,312 --> 03:41:22,312
nwerd_gamer: holy grad

638
03:41:23,478 --> 03:41:25,478
UltraScientism: @inceptiondev Rust is too onerous and inflexible. Ocaml on the other hand is almost like python in experienced hands.

639
03:42:12,170 --> 03:42:14,170
Zerotobeahero: The gpu for noobs stream that was in rust, was good I think I even learned something.

640
03:42:37,150 --> 03:42:39,150
jnpl95: Yeah was a fun stream

641
03:42:38,689 --> 03:42:40,689
dramatemple: If you write it in Ocaml, it is not a open source anymore

642
03:42:40,952 --> 03:42:42,952
leikowo: except that the gpu noob ocl program you wrote doesn't find the number of parallel execution units on NVIDIA GPUs because of the register dependencies you can run twice the max amount you should be able to

643
03:42:50,367 --> 03:42:52,367
UltraScientism: There are ML frameworks in Rust though: Candle and Burn

644
03:43:02,501 --> 03:43:04,501
m4l4r100: I want the old kanye back

645
03:43:32,086 --> 03:43:34,086
Fredirecko: thinking

646
03:43:33,862 --> 03:43:35,862

Zerwih: everything is framework nowadays

648
03:43:44,856 --> 03:43:46,856
nwerd_gamer: what do you think chat

649
03:43:50,299 --> 03:43:52,299
rain_sd: when are you going to do chip panicBasket panicBasket

650
03:43:57,613 --> 03:43:59,613
ShatZ_: I think we transition to some front end development

651
03:44:06,080 --> 03:44:08,080
rain_sd: yes

652
03:44:11,627 --> 03:44:13,627
nwerd_gamer: reach next js stream

653
03:44:14,929 --> 03:44:16,929

654
03:44:19,929 --> 03:44:21,929
ShatZ_: lets get some creativity flowing

655
03:44:25,243 --> 03:44:27,243
Zerwih: or c

656
03:44:37,646 --> 03:44:39,646
Fredirecko: these comments are def ending the stream when he gets back LUL

657
03:44:48,127 --> 03:44:50,127

658

ShatZ_: No no george seems to be in a designing type of mood

661
03:45:03,710 --> 03:45:05,710
dramatemple: @Fredirecko I was thinking that, too

662
03:45:14,795 --> 03:45:16,795
leikowo: tinygrad being written in a language with less overhead would have meant less weird  tricks to make it reasonably fast (eg: fast enum metaclass ...)

663
03:45:23,922 --> 03:45:25,922
arthurskylive: @leikowo dude

664

03:45:42,983 --> 03:45:44,983
vox_bony: time chair

668
03:45:44,834 --> 03:45:46,834
dramatemple: Isn't the font size is quite small for the stream, why no one was complaining xD

669
03:45:55,387 --> 03:45:57,387
arthurskylive: everybody shut up

670
03:46:28,932 --> 03:46:30,932
jnpl95: @leikowo Casey Muratori showed how many assembly instructions  you had to do with just a single add instruction in python vs c, its crazy, the amount of overhead

671
03:46:29,939 --> 03:46:31,939
inceptiondev: @dramatemple just get glasses lol

672
03:46:47,538 --> 03:46:49,538

689
03:47:11,950 --> 03:47:13,950
Martinni39: has anyone taking up your 10k a day startup review service?

690
03:47:18,291 --> 03:47:20,291
inceptiondev: @dramatemple just get a bigger monitor then so it fits more stuff

691
03:47:19,923 --> 03:47:21,923
nwerd_gamer: should i drop out of college and only study tinygrad

692
03:47:30,780 --> 03:47:32,780
rain_sd: OK

693
03:47:35,550 --> 03:47:37,550
urnebeani: yes

694
03:47:39,556 --> 03:47:41,556
UltraScientism: how much for Pizza in San Diego?

695
03:47:44,902 --> 03:47:46,902
arthurskylive: nah

696
03:47:56,445 --> 03:47:58,445
leikowo: college is useful if you actually study ...

697
03:48:00,215 --> 03:48:02,215
Zerotobeahero: that is expensive

698
03:48:02,965 --> 03:48:04,965
Zeevo: rate it out of 10

699
03:48:06,889 --> 03:48:08,889
Fredirecko: that's actually less than i would have thought

700
03:48:15,942 --> 03:48:17,942
pronto_letterbox: the pipsas

701
03:48:16,529 --> 03:48:18,529
m4l4r100: whats one thing that you value on a good pizza?

702
03:48:17,482 --> 03:48:19,482
rain_sd: OK

703
03:48:40,078 --> 03:48:42,078
leikowo: wait how much is a pizza here ?

Coraxxi: amateur score, no decimals

705
03:48:46,619 --> 03:48:48,619
jawnming: hi geo! im going to cmu next year and was wondering if you had any advice other than drop out. also, how would i go about studying tinygrad with a crap base in linear algebra

706
03:48:58,577 --> 03:49:00,577
dramatemple: I listened George 5 years ago while he was praising NVIDIA, all in and bought stocks. Happy life

707

03:51:23,055 --> 03:51:25,055
Fredirecko: is "bus-getter-onners" an offical morgan freeman word?

712
03:51:25,307 --> 03:51:27,307

skarmorysavvy: bring a horse to water something something

719
03:51:47,829 --> 03:51:49,829
thomas_the_tank_engine: I'm working on the x86 backend, do we want to add the location of uops and spill/fill uops in viz?

720
03:51:48,510 --> 03:51:50,510
rivetingco: ive never asked for advice, ever

721
03:52:04,257 --> 03:52:06,257
internal_static_void_: Shout out to the literal army of people "how do I do a c++" in programming streams. Just go do it bro

722
03:52:17,190 --> 03:52:19,190
thomas_the_tank_engine: its locked to me

723
03:52:20,634 --> 03:52:22,634
jnpl95: So 95% of therapy issues boil down to execution friction?

724
03:52:24,878 --> 03:52:26,878
thomas_the_tank_engine: not really its almost done

725
03:52:32,898 --> 03:52:34,898
thomas_the_tank_engine: yeah

726
03:52:34,833 --> 03:52:36,833

colonizethemoon: pizza looks spicy

729
03:53:16,288 --> 03:53:18,288
thomas_the_tank_engine: spill uops are stores and fill uops are loads. they are added after reg alloc

730
03:53:16,310 --> 03:53:18,310
rain_sd: eating pizzzzzzzzza

uloop: BTW am I misremembering or is the OpenCL backend gone?

732
03:53:30,152 --> 03:53:32,152
Fredirecko: i recently read an article from vitalik buterin and he referenced tinygrad

733
03:53:34,375 --> 03:53:36,375

739
03:54:39,825 --> 03:54:41,825
m4l4r100: how is the crust?

740
03:54:40,078 --> 03:54:42,078
Zeevo: I propose that we follow the lead of tinygrad, and have an explicit max line of code target for the long-term Ethereum specification, with the goal of making Ethereum consensus-critical code close to as simple as Bitcoin.

741
03:54:53,556 --> 03:54:55,556
internal_static_void_: @dramatemple Can lead a horse to water, can't make them drink

742
03:54:57,072 --> 03:54:59,072
internal_static_void_: Same analogy

743
03:55:02,512 --> 03:55:04,512
oldtimergamedev: that's a very cynical view

744
03:55:28,966 --> 03:55:30,966
UltraScientism: being a bus getteronner or not is likely a question of neurophisiology

745
03:55:34,069 --> 03:55:36,069
allcliffs: but that does not apply to young people, you can change their ways :)

746
03:55:57,206 --> 03:55:59,206
smarttties: @georgehotz What is your take on using LLMs for daily work (C++ and graphics)? I've tried using them myself but the results have been underwhelming, and I often feel like I’m not learning anything when I use/rely on them.

747
03:56:01,753 --> 03:56:03,753
internal_static_void_: Dude if people want to get into programming they're going to get into it and be interested on their own or they're going to sink or swim in their career

748
03:56:05,161 --> 03:56:07,161
Agression113: yep, excuses

749
03:56:06,518 --> 03:56:08,518
leikowo: do you regret python having this much overhead ? (like having to do tricks like FastEnum which isn't clean nor of any value outside python)

750
03:56:58,807 --> 03:57:00,807

753
03:57:28,363 --> 03:57:30,363
DIUS3R: you can change, for instance by changing your environment. once you see people getting on the bus, the likelihood of  you getting on that fcking bus increases

754
03:57:41,111 --> 03:57:43,111
dramatemple: @smarttties LLMs sucks with graphics

755
03:57:44,478 --> 03:57:46,478
leikowo: okay yeah. though It's just sad that any algorithmic improvements you make are nerfed by the lang

756
03:57:58,743 --> 03:58:00,743
Marvfinator: damn that pizza looks nice

757
03:58:07,559 --> 03:58:09,559

765
03:59:28,068 --> 03:59:30,068
