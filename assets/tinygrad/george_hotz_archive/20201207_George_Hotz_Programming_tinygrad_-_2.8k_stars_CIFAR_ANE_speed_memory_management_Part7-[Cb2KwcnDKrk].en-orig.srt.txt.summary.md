# George Hotz TinyGrad Coding Stream Summary

George Hotz (geohot) works on TinyGrad, a compact machine learning framework he describes as "PyTorch but tinier" that's designed to stay under 1000 lines of code while supporting both CPU and GPU operations.

## Main Accomplishments

1. **Memory Management Improvements**:
   - Fixed memory leaks in the backward pass
   - Added proper tensor deallocation
   - Created a garbage collection test
   - Added `requires_grad` property to tensors

2. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Separated tensor storage from shape information
   - Added a GPU buffer class
   - Refactored the reshape operation to avoid unnecessary copies
   - Implemented a `get_parameters()` utility function

3. **Training Implementation**:
   - Set up CIFAR dataset training
   - Implemented a simple batch normalization for stabilizing training
   - Fixed initialization of network parameters
   - Discovered why training wasn't working (vanishing gradients without batch norm)

4. **Apple Neural Engine (ANE) Exploration**:
   - Reverse engineered compiler output formats
   - Discovered operation codes and data structures
   - Found ways to generate debug output from ANE compiler
   - Analyzed binary structure of neural engine commands
   - Identified command blocks with lengths and addresses

Throughout the stream, George maintained his commitment to keeping TinyGrad small, even removing unused operations like division to stay under the 1000-line limit. He also shared his strong opinions about programming tools, particularly disliking Apple's switch from bash to zsh as the default shell.

The stream showcased George's approach to debugging, refactoring, and reverse engineering complex systems.
