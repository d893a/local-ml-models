# George Hotz: Giving Up on AMD GPUs for TinyGrad/Tiny Box

## Core Frustrations with AMD
After 9 months working with AMD GPUs for his company's "Tiny Box" AI computers, George Hotz has reached a breaking point:

- **Closed-source firmware** with no documentation is causing persistent reliability issues
- **Multiple layers of complexity** in both user space and kernel drivers
- **Poor error reporting** with issues like "in-order queue deadlocks" that AMD can't explain
- **Lack of transparency** despite multiple meetings and emails with AMD representatives
- AMD provided "platitudes and business jargon" instead of technical documentation

## Technical Investigation
The stream shows Hotz exploring AMD's GPU architecture:

- **Firmware components**: Platform Security Processor (PSP), Command Processor (CP), Micro Engine Scheduler (MES), Run List Controller (RLC), etc.
- Successfully removed AMD's entire user space stack (ROCm, HIP) with TinyGrad's own implementation
- Still can't fix kernel-level issues without documentation on how these components interact
- Discovered that firmware binaries appear to be ARM code with no strings, making reverse engineering difficult
- Built a custom kernel module to trace firmware loading and register writes

## The Ultimatum
Hotz issued a clear deadline to AMD:

> "If zero relevant docs or code by Monday, we are done. Not going to help those who don't want to help themselves."

Specifically requesting:
- Documentation for GC, CP, MES, RLC, PFP, ME and SDMA components
- Not asking for PSP or SMU to be open-sourced
- Will accept docs without removing firmware signing requirements

## Business Decision
- Will switch all Tiny Box computers from AMD to NVIDIA GPUs
- Plans to sell ~72 AMD 7900 XTX GPUs on eBay
- Calls NVIDIA more reliable: "Everything with NVIDIA just works"
- Though NVIDIA is also closed source, their implementations are stable enough for ML workloads

## Philosophical Takeaways
- "If using AMD is harder than taping out our own chip, we'll do that"
- Draws contrast between companies with strong leadership (like Elon Musk's) vs bureaucratic organizations
- Argues AMD's 8% GPU market share won't improve without addressing software issues
- Emphasizes that reverse engineering isn't sustainable for building production systems

The stream represents Hotz's final attempt to understand AMD's architecture before abandoning it for his company's products, with a mix of technical exploration, business pragmatism, and evident frustration.
