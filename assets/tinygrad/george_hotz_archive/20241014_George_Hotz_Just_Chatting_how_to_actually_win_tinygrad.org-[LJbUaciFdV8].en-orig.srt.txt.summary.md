# George Hotz: "How to Actually Win" - TinyGrad Vision Summary

## Core Philosophy: Decentralizing AI Compute

George Hotz articulates his vision for TinyGrad and Tiny Corp, focused on creating a decentralized marketplace for AI computation where:

> "AI infrastructure must be taken for granted as free in the same way Linux is"

His central thesis is that current AI development suffers from excessive rent-seeking at multiple levels of the stack:
- Silicon manufacturing → TSMC → NVIDIA → Cloud providers → AI applications
- Each layer adds margins, resulting in artificially high compute costs

## Technical Architecture

TinyGrad provides:
1. A concise language to express entire machine learning jobs (10KB can specify a $15M training job)
2. A compiler that determines optimal execution order
3. A runtime that works across different hardware without modification
4. Hardware abstraction that makes the underlying GPU irrelevant to the user

## The Franchise Model

Rather than building massive data centers himself (the "modernist approach"), Hotz advocates a franchise system:

- People buy Tiny Boxes and connect them to the network
- Pay small franchise fees to be part of the marketplace
- Tiny Corp routes jobs based on pricing and availability
- Enables diverse, decentralized competition against large cloud providers

## Competitive Advantages

- **Hardware flexibility:** "Use whatever GPUs make sense" - not locked to specific vendors
- **Location flexibility:** Can be placed anywhere, including areas with cheap power
- **Less stringent uptime:** Training jobs can handle occasional outages
- **Simplified management:** Abstracted infrastructure reduces operational overhead

## Market Philosophy

Hotz views himself as a "postmodernist" rather than "modernist" - focusing on infrastructure that enables others rather than controlling the entire stack:

> "If I win, I win as a postmodernist... the best we can hope for is a free market"

He believes this approach prevents centralized control of AI development while enabling greater innovation through market competition.

## Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Hotz sees:
- AI compute becoming increasingly distributed
- 13-15 years until what people consider "the singularity"
- Markets with AI entities hiring other AI entities
- Humanity's relationship to advanced AI becoming like "mouse civilization compared to their civilization"

His ultimate goal is not to build AGI himself but to create infrastructure that prevents monopolistic control of AI resources, making the development pathway more equitable and accessible.
