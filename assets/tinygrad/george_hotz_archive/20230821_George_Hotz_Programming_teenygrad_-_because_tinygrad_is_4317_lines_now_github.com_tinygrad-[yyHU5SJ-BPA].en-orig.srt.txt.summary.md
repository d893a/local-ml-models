# George Hotz's Teenygrad Project Summary

In this coding stream, George Hotz (geohot) creates "teenygrad," a streamlined version of his "tinygrad" neural network library. The project addresses a key issue: tinygrad had grown to 4,317 lines, far exceeding its promised 1,000-line limit.

## Core Development Process:

1. **Starting Point**: Copies essential files from tinygrad (tensor.py, size.py, ml_ops.py)
2. **Scope Reduction**: Initially aims to run LLaMA, but scales back to focus on MNIST training
3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Creates minimal versions of core components
   - Eliminates unnecessary features (most dtype support, multiple backends)
   - Uses NumPy as the single backend

## Technical Achievements:

- Successful MNIST training implementation in ~810-900 lines
- Identifies and fixes several bugs in the original tinygrad
- Creates a complete GitHub repository with CI integration

## Key Insights:

- "Every 100 lines of code has bugs. How do you write less buggy code? Write less code."
- Code complexity should be properly encapsulated with clean APIs
- The teenygrad implementation helps users understand tinygrad's core architecture

## Trade-offs:

- Teenygrad is 10+ times slower than tinygrad
- Limited to only essential functionality (primarily float32 support)
- Lacks the performance optimizations of the full version

The final product serves as both a functional neural network library and an educational tool for understanding the architecture of the more complex tinygrad.
