# George Hotz's tinygrad Development Stream Summary

This transcript documents George Hotz (geohot) livestreaming his work on "tinygrad," a minimalist deep learning framework he created. The stream focuses on improving and expanding tinygrad's capabilities.

## About tinygrad

- A compact neural network library designed to be similar to PyTorch but simpler
- Built on NumPy arrays rather than requiring custom tensors
- Includes automatic differentiation (autograd) engine
- Described as "tiny but functional" deep learning framework

## Development Goals and Achievements

1. **Implemented Adam optimizer**
   - Added code for the adaptive moment estimation algorithm
   - Compared performance against SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
   - Discussed the mathematical details and implementation challenges

2. **Code refactoring**
   - Simplified the Context/Function relationship
   - Restructured code into separate modules (optimizers, utils)
   - Made the library more "tiny" by removing unnecessary components

3. **Fixed issues**
   - Corrected NLL loss implementation to match PyTorch behavior
   - Fixed a bug in MNIST loading that was causing slow startup times

## Stream Highlights

- Compared tinygrad's API design to PyTorch, noting PyTorch's elegant design
- Merged a pull request that added CI testing capabilities
- Discussed (but didn't implement) convolutional layers and gradient checking
- Set up example code showing how to build simple neural networks with tinygrad

## Project Structure

The framework includes:
- Tensor class for handling array operations
- Function class for defining operations and their gradients
- Optimizers (SGD and Adam)
- Example implementations of neural networks (TinyBobNet)

Throughout the stream, Hotz emphasized keeping the library minimal while maintaining functionality comparable to larger frameworks, with the philosophy that implementing something is the best way to truly understand it.
