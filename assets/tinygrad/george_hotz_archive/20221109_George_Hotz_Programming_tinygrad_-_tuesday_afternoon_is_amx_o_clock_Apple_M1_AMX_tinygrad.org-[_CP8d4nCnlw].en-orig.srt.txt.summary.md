# George Hotz tinygrad Programming Stream Summary

George Hotz spent this stream implementing support for Apple M1's AMX (Apple Matrix eXtensions) instructions in his machine learning framework called tinygrad. The primary goal was to significantly improve matrix multiplication performance.

## Technical Progress

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Created a minimal test using LLVM to access the AMX instructions
   - Overcame an early challenge with the ASM parser configuration

2. **AMX Implementation**:
   - Built helper functions for AMX operations (ldx, ldy, stx, sty, fma32, etc.)
   - Created proper register management for the AMX unit's 16x16 register matrix

3. **Matrix Multiplication**:
   - Implemented matrix multiplication using AMX instructions
   - Worked through complex pointer arithmetic and register offsets
   - Extended implementation to handle larger matrices by tiling operations

4. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Added support for multiple AMX registers to process larger chunks
   - Implemented proper caching strategies for matrix operations
   - Fixed issues with matrix transposition and element alignment

## Results

- Started with code that was ~1000x slower than PyTorch's implementation
- Through optimization, reduced this to only 1.8x slower than PyTorch
- Achieved approximately 550 gigaFLOPS of performance

Despite the significant improvements, George remained curious about why PyTorch's implementation was still faster. He hypothesized this might be due to proprietary optimizations in Apple's libraries or subtle cache management techniques.

The stream ended with the code working correctly, merged into the "chunker" branch of tinygrad, and usable on M1 Macs.
