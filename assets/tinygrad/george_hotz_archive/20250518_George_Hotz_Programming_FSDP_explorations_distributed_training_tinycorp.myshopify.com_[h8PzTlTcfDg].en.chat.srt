edersantana: I've been finetuning LLMs with pytorch... but I haven't trained one from scratch xD

164
02:07:30,766 --> 02:07:32,766
Alexis_Lionel: Thanks for merging my PR yesterday. Wanted to play around with OpenAI's new Codex agent, so I fed it the tinygrad repo. It found that typo and a couple of other bugs that I'm still trying to wrap my head around. Great way to burn through OpenAI's VC money while it's unlimited. Might be a great way to automate <$500 bounties actually. Even runs the test suite after its changes in its env

165
02:07:49,463 --> 02:07:51,463
Alexis_Lionel: The typo one

166
02:09:13,578 --> 02:09:15,578

167
02:09:29,672 --> 02:09:31,672
gliched_robot: @georgehotz Jeff Hinton mentioned his same code can train llm in 1 GPU and 1000 gpu... it would be great if tinygrad can go that

168
02:12:58,994 --> 02:13:00,994
Alexis_Lionel: Sure, I always make sure to understand the AI-proposed changes deeply myself. My point was that Codex is very different from Cursor and looks more suited to your workflow. Free bug-hunting, basically

169
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:59,540
