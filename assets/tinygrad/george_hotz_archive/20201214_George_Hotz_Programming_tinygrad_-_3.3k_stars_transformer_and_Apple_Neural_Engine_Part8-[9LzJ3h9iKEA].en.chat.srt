3093
03:43:30,092 --> 03:43:34,092
teayoflow: @many_mangos it is limited to the data it trains on. For example, do you think GPT3 could design the new yeezys?

3546
04:32:55,988 --> 04:32:59,988
UltraScientism: @brbdontdie when you've invested so much time into being productive in it, you have to justify the time spent... LUL

3547
04:33:07,613 --> 04:33:11,613
Qwertclyde1029: that's pog content

3548
04:33:34,388 --> 04:33:38,388
brbdontdie: @safetotype I wasn't trying to advocate for a better editor. I was just curious

3549
04:33:40,391 --> 04:33:44,391
bojosos: What does * do?

3550
04:33:47,440 --> 04:33:51,440
BRAINSPELL: why is one paranoid.... do doors shut magically behind you?

3551
04:33:51,979 --> 04:33:55,979
livebullsh1t: open var

3552
04:33:53,794 --> 04:33:57,794

3553
04:34:03,367 --> 04:34:07,367

3554
04:34:07,992 --> 04:34:11,992
brbdontdie: @UltraScientism lol i feel that.

3555
04:34:08,684 --> 04:34:12,684
BRAINSPELL: the spring on the door shuts them automagically padawan

3556
04:34:12,434 --> 04:34:16,434
RealOden: once you're used to the keybindings you really miss them when you use editors that don't have them

3557
04:34:12,530 --> 04:34:16,530
devdual: @ZX10RSE yeah

3558
04:34:12,932 --> 04:34:16,932

3559
04:34:39,093 --> 04:34:43,093
FargioFarmani: Even septuagintuple zip woks.

3560
04:35:07,837 --> 04:35:11,837
RealOden: one of the best things about vim is that it's fast, no load times to open the editor or a file

3561
04:35:29,126 --> 04:35:33,126
livebullsh1t: and she'll friendly

3562
04:35:35,379 --> 04:35:39,379
safetotype: @brbdontdie if hes anything like me, vim offers good extensible and configurability that something like vscode gets real close to be but much lighter weight and works in the vim where im already comfortable

3563
04:35:56,408 --> 04:36:00,408
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: Yeah, my emacs sometimes get slow and buggy as hell in C++ mode.

3564
04:35:58,191 --> 04:36:02,191
safetotype: in the terminal***

3565
04:36:02,134 --> 04:36:06,134
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: its very very annoying

3566
04:38:00,661 --> 04:38:04,661
Qwertclyde1029: wtf why is python segfaulting

3567
04:38:01,562 --> 04:38:05,562
brbdontdie: @safetotype that's fair. I am really slow on vim, but I only know the basic vim commands so that makes sense.

3568
04:38:19,538 --> 04:38:23,538
lrnq: NotLikeThis

3569
04:38:21,184 --> 04:38:25,184
UltraScientism: @RealOden Actually VIM isn't fast, unless they fundamentally redid how it renders text. In the era of Celeron 450 it was quite laggy, and it was by design.

3570
04:38:34,013 --> 04:38:38,013
UltraScientism: That's compared to other editors.

3571
04:38:43,574 --> 04:38:47,574
marcelbischoff: can you trigger the ane with something else to see if it segfaults more often?

3572
04:38:45,452 --> 04:38:49,452
oskrM: also plz fix

3573
04:38:58,779 --> 04:39:02,779

3574
04:39:09,652 --> 04:39:13,652
bubblesnot: Geohot works for apple now?

3575
04:39:23,144 --> 04:39:27,144
RealOden: @UltraScientism I was referring to the time it takes to open a file and the load times of modern editors but ok

3576
04:39:53,370 --> 04:39:57,370
gilga_m: Are vim and emacs working well with large codebase by working on multiple files simultaneously?

3577
04:40:08,974 --> 04:40:12,974
josalt: Hey everyone!

3578
04:40:30,396 --> 04:40:34,396
jmp0ut: opcodes easy enough to locate?

3579
04:40:32,562 --> 04:40:36,562
safetotype: @brbdontdie thats fair it takes practice , but the real advantage is in remapping keys, also a lot of good work is going into neovim making it a more fully fledged ide

3580
04:41:28,311 --> 04:41:32,311
gussyyy_: Why is he so smart?

3581
04:41:42,098 --> 04:41:46,098
brbdontdie: Does George use neovim?

3582
04:42:03,991 --> 04:42:07,991
safetotype: @UltraScientism vim is lightening fast, what is there exactly to re-render? vim is slow in search since it does index like more bloated editors do, but I find thats really its only downfall

3583
04:42:14,647 --> 04:42:18,647
teayoflow: George doesn't even use arch btw

3584
04:42:22,062 --> 04:42:26,062

3585
04:42:43,224 --> 04:42:47,224

04:42:55,057 --> 04:42:59,057
josalt: oh no

3588
04:42:56,829 --> 04:43:00,829
UltraScientism: @safetotype haven't used it in a while, I believe that it's fast on modern CPUs.

3589
04:42:58,401 --> 04:43:02,401
safetotype: I like he use stock vim with a couple of edits https://github.com/geohot/configuration/blob/master/.vimrc

3590
04:43:00,838 --> 04:43:04,838
